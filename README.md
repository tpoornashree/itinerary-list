# To Do List
✏️ A simple todo list developed using html, css and javascript to organize and prioritize tasks ❗
 


#  working explained

➡️ The homepage contains an input field to enter the task and an add button ❗



➡️ After clicking the add button, the task which you added will get stored locally in a separate box with a strikethrough and delete option ❗
 


➡️ If you pressed add button without entering any task, then the page will alert with "Empty task!" ❗


➡️ If you finished a task you can strikethrough that task by clicking on the taskname ❗


➡️ If you accidentally entered a task, you can delete using the delete icon ❗
